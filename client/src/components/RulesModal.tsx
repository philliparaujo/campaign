                <strong>1. Advertising</strong>
                <br />
                Spend coins to rent out floors for advertisements. An
                advertisement improves your polling, but only for roads that can
                see it.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>2. Polling</strong>
                <br />
                Select a region of the city to poll. Polls that favor you boost
                public opinion, but non-representative polls may be called out
                for being unfair, losing public opinion.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>3. Fact-Checking</strong>
                <br />
                Evaluate how accurately your opponentâ€™s poll reflects the whole
                city. Win or lose public opinion with accusations, or play it
                safe by trusting their poll.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>4. Funding</strong>
                <br />
                Advertisements are reset, and campaigns receive coins based on
                public opinion. True poll results are released.
              </p>
